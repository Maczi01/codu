# "How Do I Prevent Burnout?"Â + Your Weekly Picks

Welcome to CodÃº Weekly!

A few weeks ago, I was asked which was slightly different.

**"How do I prevent burnout?"**

Usually, we hear the question, "How do you recover from burnout," so this really has had me thinking over the last few weeks. I've looked through articles and even some books on the topic.

If you have been lucky enough to avoid burnout in your career, that is fantastic. But I know for myself and many others it's been one of the lowest points in life and can accumulate because of many factors. And, incredibly, it doesn't always align with overworking.

To keep the email shorter for those who don't need the tips, I'll link you to an article I just published on the topic here:
